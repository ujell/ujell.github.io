I'm a mixed reality designer, developer and enthusiast with a computer science background. 

At Fraunhofer FIT, I've worked on many projects that have brought AR and VR to various fields, including healthcare, culture and marketing. Right now I am working on the [IndustrieStadtpark project](https://www.5gtroisdorf.de), where we are enhancing real production environments with industrial metaverse. 

I mainly work with Unity, but I also have experience in other areas, especially Node.js and iOS.
