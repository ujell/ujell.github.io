I'm a Mixed Reality designer, developer and enthusiast with a computer science background. 

At Fraunhofer FIT, I've worked on many projects that have brought AR and VR to various fields. Right now I am working on the [WIRKsam](https://wirksam.nrw) project *(Unity, OpenXR)*, aiming to showcase how AI enhances the textile industry for the public, prospective partners, and the teams of our current partners using XR. 

Here are some of my previous projects:

- [5G IndustrieStadtpark Troisdorf project](https://www.5gtroisdorf.de) *(HoloLens2, Oculus, Unity)*: An industrial metaverse project where I have developed a collaborative environment featuring digital twins, avatars, guideline and training features, along with external device support and an authoring tool. Here is a video explaining a bit about the overall project:

- [Kuraray Solutions Finder App](https://magazin.kuraray.eu/2021/07/21/solution-finder-new-app-offers-a-window-into-optimum-interlayer-selection/) *(iOS and Android, Unity)*: Kuraray is an international chemicals manufacturer that produces films for windows to alter color and insulation properties. I developed a mobile app to help customers select the best product for their needs, which is still available on [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solution-finder/id1574510476).
